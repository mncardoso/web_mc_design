          <h2>Logo Process</h2>
          <p>
            First I studied the business and the location. Then based on the mood board, started with the shape of the
            old house and added some of its most characteristic elements, such as ivy branches, window frames and front
            wall colors. The font chosen was a paintbrush style suggesting the old age and style the place but with a
            brand new look. The choice of the color respected the predominant regional tones.

            All the pictures were taken on location and edited to keep the vintage look and feel (no retouch done, as
            the client wanted a realistic look so that the guests wouldn&apos;t be deceived)

            “I am very happy with the result of Miguel&apos;s work! In a very competitive business as house lodging we
            have to stand out, so that we can stay in business for long than one year and keep growing. Miguel&apos;s
            work helped us achieve that! Not only our logo reflects the spirit of Casa Rústica, but also the pictures
            are appealing and realistic, not defrauding guests, which results in more good reviews and more bookings
            each year!” Susana N. CEO of Casa Rústica
